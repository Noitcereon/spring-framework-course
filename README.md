# Spring Framework 6 course

This repository contains code I have made during the [Spring Framework 6: Beginner to Guru](https://udemy.com/course/spring-framework-6-beginner-to-guru) course.

I will update this README later to give a brief description of each subproject in here.

## Subprojects

The course gives rise to different projects, which I put into this git Repo. Each subsection will have a brief description of the project.

### spring-6-web-app

The first project, which shows how to quickly make a Spring application with Spring Boot in a typical pattern with repositories, services, controllers and views.

It uses Spring MVC, Spring Data, Thymeleaf and an H2 (in-memory) database to build a very simple webapp based on books, authors and publishers.

It uses the embedded Tomcat container and runs on localhost:8080. The pages are accessible at context paths: `/books` and `/authors`.


### spring-core

Learning about the Spring Framework core, such as dependency injection.
